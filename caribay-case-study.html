        <p>This was a project for my Graphic Design III class in spring of 2024, the problem was coming up with an interesting beverage brand. So I decided to deveop a a brnd for venezuelan living in Miami.
            So that is how I came up with Caribay, and started to create the design for the brand, because it was individual I worked in the packaging design by myself.  </p>
        <h2>The process</h2>
        <p>For this project I started with a moodboard to set the modd af the brand, I based the concept in an  old venezuelan tale called "Las Cinco Agu√≠las Blancas" (The Five White Eagles).
            So, I proceed to do the logo design and the eagle designs that would decorate the package. Then I set the designs in a layout to start with the design of the package, I started with the logo
            and when I was done with it I proceed to design the eagles that would decorate the package.
